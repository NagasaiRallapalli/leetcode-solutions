## 📌 Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` in-place.

Return the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val`.

---

## 💡 Example

### Input

```text
nums = [3,2,2,3]
val = 3
```

### Output

```text
2
```

### Explanation

After removing all occurrences of `3`, the array contains:

```text
[2,2]
```

The number of remaining elements is `2`.

---

## 🚀 Approach

This solution traverses the array **from right to left**.

1. Start from the last index.
2. If the current element is equal to `val`, remove it using `remove()`.
3. Continue until all elements are checked.
4. Return the length of the remaining array.

Traversing from right to left avoids problems with changing indexes while removing elements.

## 💻 Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
            if val == nums[i]:
                nums.remove(nums[i])

        return len(nums)
```

## 📊 Complexity Analysis

| Complexity | Value |
|------------|-------|
| **Time Complexity** | **O(n²)** |
| **Space Complexity** | **O(1)** |

### ⏱️ Time Complexity

The `remove()` operation can take `O(n)` because elements may need to be shifted.

In the worst case, `remove()` can be called multiple times.

Therefore:

**O(n²)**

### 💾 Space Complexity

No extra data structure is used.

**O(1)**
